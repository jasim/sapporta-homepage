# sapporta-homepage-app

This is a Sapporta project. Sapporta is a TypeScript library for building
database applications with schema-as-code table definitions, generated CRUD
APIs, auth-aware row access, and a React app shell.

## Commands

- `pnpm dev` starts the API and frontend in watch mode.
- `pnpm build` compiles the shared package, API, and frontend.
- `pnpm start` runs the production server after `pnpm build`.
- `pnpm exec sapporta describe` inspects the running API.
- `pnpm generate:api-reference` rebuilds the generated Sapporta API reference.
- `pnpm check:api-reference` fails if the committed API reference is stale.
- `pnpm generate:docs-index` rebuilds the `/docs` index from the sidebar.
- `pnpm check:docs-index` fails if the committed `/docs` index is stale.

Prefer the project-local CLI form: `pnpm exec sapporta ...`.

## Where to make changes

- Tables: add or edit schema files in `packages/api/schema/`, then generate and
  apply a migration.
- Backend routes: add contracts in `packages/shared/src/contracts/`, handlers in
  `packages/api/app/`, and mount them from `packages/api/app.ts`.
- Frontend screens: add routes and navigation in `packages/frontend/src/App.tsx`.
- Browser API calls: add typed clients in `packages/frontend/src/api.ts`.
- Auth and permissions: start in `packages/api/authz/`. Read the auth docs before
  changing row access rules.
- Documentation landing page: `packages/docs/src/content/docs/docs.md` is
  generated — never edit it. Change `packages/docs/sidebar.mjs` and run
  `pnpm generate:docs-index`. The page is the index of every documentation page,
  served as `/docs` and as `/docs.md` for coding agents.
- Sapporta API reference: the pages under `packages/docs/src/generated/api-reference/`
  are generated — never edit them. Change `packages/api-reference/` and run
  `pnpm generate:api-reference`. Bump the `@sapporta/*` versions in
  `packages/api-reference/package.json` to document a newer release.

## Schema and migrations

```bash
pnpm --filter ./packages/api db:generate --name add_table
pnpm --filter ./packages/api db:migrate
pnpm --filter ./packages/api db:check
```

Review generated SQL before applying it. The server checks migration readiness at
startup, validates table definitions, and does not apply migrations
automatically.

## Backend routes

App-owned API routes are served under `/api`.

For a typed custom endpoint, keep the wire shape in `packages/shared`, the
handler in `packages/api/app`, and the browser client in
`packages/frontend/src/api.ts`.

The `/api/hello` example shows the usual route shape:

1. `packages/shared/src/contracts/foo.ts`: declare the request and response
   contract. Re-export it from `packages/shared/src/contracts/index.ts`, which
   is re-exported by `packages/shared/src/index.ts`.
2. `packages/api/app/foo.ts`: register the contract and handler with
   `api.register(...)`, then default-export the route app.
3. `packages/frontend/src/api.ts`: pass the contract to
   `createApiClient(contract, { baseUrl: getApiBase })`.

Because both sides import the same contract, request and response types stay in
sync. When the app's real API calls are in place, replace the `hello` contract,
handler, client entry, and `Welcome` screen with the app feature.

When adding a new route file under `packages/api/app/`, mount it in
`packages/api/app.ts`; files are not exposed automatically. Add a route to
`publicApiRoutes` only when anonymous visitors should be able to call it.

## Auth and row access

Apply auth scope on the server. Generated table endpoints apply row visibility
for you. Custom code should choose the route's ability and data authority, then
use row-scoped helpers for ordinary table work.

Do not trust clients to choose workspace, owner, role, or scope columns. Raw SQL
bypasses row helpers and should be a fallback, not the default mutation path.

## Email

This project uses Nodemailer through `packages/api/mailer.ts`.
`createSapportaMailer()` returns the Nodemailer transport, parsed defaults, and
a `sendMail()` helper.

`packages/api/app.ts` receives the mailer in `loadApp()` options. Routes can use
it directly or pass it into domain modules without importing auth internals.

In development, `SAPPORTA_MAIL_TRANSPORT=stream` logs the complete generated
email source to the API console instead of delivering it. Production SMTP setup
is documented in `DEPLOYMENT.md`.

## Frontend

The frontend uses React, Vite, Tailwind, `@sapporta/ui`, shadcn/ui conventions,
and Radix primitives. Prefer existing Sapporta UI components and local patterns
before adding new component abstractions. Use lucide icons for icon buttons when
an appropriate icon exists.

Protected app routes live in `appProtectedRoutes`; public routes live in
`appPublicRoutes`.

## Shared package

`packages/shared/` is a leaf package. Both the API and frontend may depend on
it; it must not depend on either of them.

Put these things in shared:

- API contracts and wire-format request/response types.
- Shared value types used by both API handlers and UI state.
- Pure serializers, parsers, and constants for those shapes.

Do not put React components, Hono handlers, Drizzle queries, database access, or
other I/O in shared.

Use Temporal for time and date work. Do not use `Date`, `dayjs`, or `date-fns`
for parsing, arithmetic, comparison, or formatting.
