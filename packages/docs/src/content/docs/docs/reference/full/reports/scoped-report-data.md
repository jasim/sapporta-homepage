Report routes use normal route authorization and normal scoped data access.

```ts
api.register(
  "incomeStatement",
  incomeStatementRoute,
  async ({ c, request }) => {
    const auth = c.get("auth");
    auth.requireAuthenticated();
    auth.requireCan("read", "reports:income-statement");

    const rows = await readIncomeStatementRows({
      db: c.get("db"),
      auth,
      input: request.query,
    });

    return { status: 200, body: toIncomeStatementResult(rows) };
  },
);
```

Keep handlers thin:

- Resolve auth and request input in the route handler.
- Read rows in a data function that receives `auth` explicitly.
- Map rows to `GridDataset` in a pure function.

For Drizzle reads, compose the table's row-security predicate:

```ts
const accountAccess = auth.rowSecurity.forTable(accounts);

const rows = await db
  .select()
  .from(accounts.drizzle)
  .where(accountAccess.ownedRows());
```

For raw SQL, make visible base tables explicit with CTEs before composing the
report query. Do not accept workspace or user scope from client parameters.
